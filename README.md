# Journal

Just a project I've been mulling around for a while. An app that lets me track my thoughts and writings everywhere I want. The goal of this
project is to have an app that I can run on a thumb drive and store the data locally on the thumb drive.

## TODO

- [ ] Basic editing functionality.
- [ ] Basic authentication, username and password
- [ ] Re-usable plugable template fragments
- [ ] Categories
- [ ] Make the data store configurable.
- [ ] Look into SQLLite or binary file formats.
- [ ] Entries sorted by date.
- [ ] Entries listed by year/month/day in tree format.
